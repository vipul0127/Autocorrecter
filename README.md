# Autocorrector

## Overview

The Autocorrector project is a simple web-based application that provides word similarity suggestions. Built using Flask, it leverages text similarity measures to suggest corrections or similar words based on an input word. This tool can be particularly useful for applications involving text input correction, spelling suggestions, or natural language processing tasks.

## Features

- **Word Similarity Suggestions:** Uses Jaccard similarity to find and suggest words similar to the user's input from a pre-defined corpus.
- **Interactive Web Interface:** Provides a user-friendly web interface where users can input words and view suggestions in real-time.
- **Simple Setup:** Requires minimal setup and configuration. Just ensure that the text file with the corpus is available.

## How It Works

1. **Corpus Loading:** The application loads a text file (`book.txt`) that contains a large set of words. This file is used to build a word frequency list.
2. **Word Processing:** The input word is compared against the words in the corpus using Jaccard similarity, a measure of how similar two sets are.
3. **Suggestion Generation:** The application generates and ranks suggestions based on their similarity scores and returns them to the user.

## Web Interface

The web interface allows users to:

1. **Input a Word:** Enter a word into a text field and submit it to get suggestions.
2. **View Suggestions:** Receive a list of similar words along with their similarity scores.

The interface is styled using simple CSS to ensure a clean and user-friendly experience.

## File Structure

- `app.py`: The main Flask application file containing the logic for word similarity and web interface routes.
- `book.txt`: A text file containing the corpus of words used for generating similarity suggestions. Ensure this file is present in the same directory as `app.py`.
- `templates/index.html`: HTML file that defines the layout and user interface for the application.

## Example

**User Input:**
```
example
```

**Suggested Corrections:**
```
- example (Similarity: 100%)
- sample (Similarity: 85%)
- exampled (Similarity: 70%)
...
```
